why this table is being created user_log

The user_log table is introduced as a way to store information about deleted rows because once a row is deleted from the user table, its data is permanently removed unless it is backed up or logged somewhere else.

In your case, if you want to calculate total_salary during the deletion of a row and save that information, a log table like user_log is a common and practical approach.

Why is user_log Needed?
Purpose of Logging:
The user_log table stores details of users (like their calculated total_salary) before their data is deleted. This is useful for:

Auditing: Keeping track of deleted records.
Data Recovery: Restoring deleted data if needed.
Historical Tracking: Retaining a record of past actions for analysis.
Alternative to Modifying OLD:
Since the OLD pseudo-record is read-only during a DELETE operation, you cannot modify it to store calculated values (like total_salary). Instead, you log these values in another table.

If You Don't Want a Log Table
If you donâ€™t want to create a log table and just want to calculate the total_salary during the delete operation, you can execute the calculation or log it via another mechanism, but the data will not persist after the DELETE.
